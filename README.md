# Robust-Aggression-Detection-in-Textual-Content-Adversarial-Learning-with-GANs
Explore neural network architectures for robust aggression detection. Comparative analysis, insights, and roadmap for safer online communication.

Maintaining online safety and responsible communication requires effective aggression detection in textual content. This research project presents a comprehensive investigation of various neural network architectures, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN), and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), in combination with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to enhance the robustness and generalization of aggression detection models.

The research paper highlights the importance of accurately differentiating between real and fake aggressive texts and explores the impact of different neural network architectures on generating realistic aggressive content. A comparative analysis is performed to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each architecture, offering valuable insights into their suitability for aggression detection tasks. The study also assesses the generalization capabilities of these models, enabling users to make informed decisions while choosing the most suitable architecture for specific aggression detection requirements.

The research findings reveal that RNN achieves the least test loss among the compared models, indicating its potential as a strong candidate for certain aggression detection tasks. However, other architectures exhibit varying levels of accuracy and robustness, emphasizing the significance of selecting appropriate models based on specific use cases. This research contributes valuable insights to the development of more accurate and robust aggression detection systems, promoting responsible and safe online communication practices.

By providing a roadmap for future developments in the field of aggression detection, this repository aims to foster advancements in the area and contribute to the overall improvement of online safety. Researchers and developers can leverage the findings to optimize neural network architectures and build more effective models, ultimately ensuring a safer and more respectful online environment.
